"""End-to-end example of using the Token Importance Unit reference model
from a silicon-agnostic compiler backend's perspective.

The TIU silicon core is deliberately small: accumulate attention mass, argmin to
pick an eviction victim, and a per-slot keep/demote comparator. The H2O policy
that decides *when* to load and evict tokens -- the recent-window protection and
the KV-budget accounting -- is a thin control-layer wrapper the compiler emits
around the core. This script shows that wrapper at three levels of sophistication,
all hitting the same Python model that is bit-exact with the RTL (and eventually
the chip):

    Level A -- budget sizing:   pick the cache size C and recent window L from the
               validated gold config, and map them onto the hardware's N_SLOTS.
    Level B -- eviction schedule: stream a token's attention over the cache, drive
               LOAD / ACC / EVICT, and collect the eviction schedule the backend
               would emit to the KV cache engine.
    Level C -- keep/demote tiers: calibrate the tier threshold from accumulated
               mass and read per-token keep(CQ-8)/demote(CQ-4) tiers off the core.

If you are a compiler engineer evaluating an integration, this is the fastest way
to see exactly what surface area you are targeting.
