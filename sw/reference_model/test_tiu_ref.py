"""Python <-> RTL parity test for the Token Importance Unit reference model.

Replays the committed golden trace `rtl/tb/testvectors/tiu_trace.hex` -- the SAME
op stream the SystemVerilog replay testbench (`rtl/tb/tb_realdata.sv`) drives into
the DUT -- through the Python model, and checks that every EVICT victim the model
returns matches the trace's expected-victim column.

The trace was generated from a real Qwen2-0.5B forward pass by
`analysis/gen_tiu_testvectors.py`; its expected column is the eviction victim the
RTL argmin produces. If the model agrees on all 40 evictions, the Python model is
bit-exact with the RTL on real data.

Run:   python -m pytest sw/reference_model/test_tiu_ref.py
